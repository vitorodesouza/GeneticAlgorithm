# Genetic Algorithm Framework
## Description
This project presents a versatile Python-based genetic algorithm framework designed for tackling a broad spectrum of optimization challenges. By incorporating a variety of genetic operators such as selection, crossover, mutation, and fitness evaluation, the framework boasts high flexibility and adaptability. It is especially suited for complex optimization tasks ranging from classical mathematical problems to real-world application scenarios like scheduling, machine learning model optimization, and more.

## Features
- Modular Design: Tailor genetic operators including crossover (e.g., Arithmetic, SinglePoint), mutation (e.g., UniformMutation), and selection methods (e.g., Roulette, Tournament, and Random Selection) to fit the specific needs of various optimization problems.
- Diverse Problem Solving: Demonstrates its utility with included examples like the Ackley Problem and Max Zero Problem, while being easily extendable to more complex scenarios such as route planning (TSP), portfolio optimization, and neural network weight optimization.
- Visualization Enhancements: Leverages Matplotlib for in-depth visualization of the algorithm's evolutionary process, offering insights into the optimization landscape and genetic diversity over generations.
- Extensibility & Customizability: Designed for users to define custom problems, mutations, crossovers, selection operators, and fitness functions by extending intuitive base classes, facilitating the exploration of novel genetic algorithm variants.
- Real-World Applications: Guides on applying the framework to real-world problems, including but not limited to, optimizing machine learning models, resource allocation, and game strategy development.
