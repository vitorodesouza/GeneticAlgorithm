# Genetic Algorithm Framework
## Description
This project is a Python-based genetic algorithm framework designed to solve optimization problems. It implements various genetic algorithm components such as selection, crossover, mutation, and fitness evaluation strategies. The framework is flexible, allowing for easy adaptation to a wide range of optimization problems, such as the Ackley function optimization and maximizing zeroes in a binary string.

## Features
- Modular Design: The framework's modular design allows users to easily customize genetic operators like crossover (Arithmetic and SinglePoint), mutation (UniformMutation), and selection methods (Roulette and Random Selection).
- Problem Solving: Included are two example problems (Ackley Problem and Max Zero Problem) to demonstrate the framework's capabilities.
- Visualization: Utilizes Matplotlib for visualizing the algorithm's performance over generations.
- Extensibility: Users can define their own problems, mutations, crossovers, and selection operators by extending base classes.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

``` bash git clone https://yourrepositorylink.git ```

Navigate to the cloned directory and install the required packages:

``` bash cd yourrepositoryname pip install -r requirements.txt ```

Usage
To run the genetic algorithm with default settings on the Ackley problem, execute:

``` python python main.py ```

You can modify main.py to experiment with different problems, genetic operators, and algorithm parameters.
